# Ice Runner
## About
Ice Runner is a game initially developed for the [Godot Wild Jam #88](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-88). The game was however unable to be submitted in time. As such I thought it would be a great idea to  open source the project, both as a gift to the community and a sort of portfolio piece.

## What Kind of Game is Ice Runner?
Ice Runner is a classic arcade style racer where you play as a penguin (currently no such model in the game) racing other penguins. The goal? Get the best time and get first place. You race on icy ponds and lakes, as well as mountains and tundras!

## Getting Started
The game uses Godot version 4.5.1 which you can get from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/). It does not use the .NET version of Godot, however it should still work.

The game has only been tested on Linux running kernel version 6.18.2.

## Warning
The game is incomplete and does not have

- Sound fx or Music
- Controls aren't finalized
- UI is rushed and buggy
- Code is very, very spaghetti and undocumented


## Will it ever be finished?

Most likely not, I may comeback to it ever so often just to mess around and test ideas.

As stated this was simply only for a game jam and really had no purpose except only to further hone my skill and be a learning experience.
