# Ice Runner
## About
Ice Runner is a game initially devoloped for the [Godot Wild Jam #88](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-88). The game was however unable to be submitted in time. As such I thought it would be a great idea to  open source the project, both as a gift to the community and a sort of portfolio piece.

## Getting Started
The game uses Godot version 4.5.1 which you can get from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/). It does not use the .NET version of Godot, however it should still work.

The game has only been tested on Linux running kernel version 6.18.2.

## Warning
The game is incomplete and does not have

- Sound fx or Music
- Controls aren't finalized
- UI is rushed and buggy
- Code is very, very spaghetti and undocumented


## Will it ever be finished?

Most likely not, I may comeback to it ever so often just to mess around and test ideas.

As stated this was simply only for a game jam and really had no purpose except only to further hone my skill and be a learning experience.
